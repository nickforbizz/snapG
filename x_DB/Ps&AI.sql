	(11, 'COMPANY PROFILE &gt; introduction', '2018-10-23 08:54:06', 'Attachment report 2018', '&lt;p&gt;Legibra is a creative studio dedicated to design, development, branding,&lt;br /&gt; printing and outsourcing of infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Its headquarters are based in Nairobi. Kenya. In addition to that, the company was founded back in 2009 by the current CEO and CTO Mr. Felix Mbugua &amp;amp; Mr. Kagai Macharia respectively. Since then it has rapidly grown rapidly since then from a small scale company based one store building to a much competent and well renounced company the current market. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s core values across the world have been creating intuitive solutions for&amp;nbsp;businesses across the globe and from a diverse range of sectors based from:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Static sites: These are non-editable internet sites.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Editable Brochure Sites: Requires a content management system.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Editable Dynamic Website: It engages the user with login areas. This site is self-managed.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;E-commerce Websites: They have a payment gateway, e.g., PayPal.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Web Application: It is a customized site with much functionality.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, below are the type of websites offered by the organization.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E-commerce Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;E-commerce is a favorite type of a website globally due to the marketing nature of it. Buyers meet sellers and transactions such as ordering, payments, and shipping are capable online due to the content management system involved. An e-commerce website contains the sales pitch zone, the products zone, and the customer check in and out process.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These sites are ideal for individuals to help share information and photos with friends. The domain registrar offers free space, and thus you use that advantage to create a personalized site. The first part of your URL have the ISP name (Internet Service Provider), and the last part has your name as a person. These sites have limited server capabilities and are not search engine optimized and hence not ideal for marketing business.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political Sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These sites give political information like campaign information, candidate&amp;rsquo;s information, political news, and blogs, etc. They help to provide first-hand information to potential&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These sites give the latest news in entertainment, weather, and sports. They offer breaking news, news update concerning the country/ the world and overall global news.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Business sites provide information about a particular company to the public. This is a great way of a company to display its products and services to new clients as well as update the existing customers on any new service or product changes or progress.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SME Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Small and medium-sized enterprises have increased their focus on online marketing, and thus SMEs sites are the most ideal due to cheaper hosting costs compared to that of corporate websites. Entrepreneurs should make their sites easy to navigate, engage clients, provide a full product description, and have a point of content. This ensures that more consumers can enjoy complete information of the business at a small space online.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consultation Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Just as the name suggests, consultation sites specifically design for offering consultative information about particular topics. The client gets information on how to solve some issues and general inquiries about everything in life.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Payment Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Due to increase in transactions demand in the current world, clients prefer to make online payments and thus a site that can include payment services is preferred. With a reliable online payment service provider (PSP), customers can efficiently pay online via bank transfers, credit cards, and real-time orders. This system offers zero risk tolerance to ensure that clients only pay for what posts online without having to incur hidden charges, especially with international transactions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writers/Authors Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These are sites designed to include a biography, excerpts, catalog of published work, links to publications of writers, etc. With a writer&amp;rsquo;s site, you get a following of people based on your social media presence such as Facebook, Twitter, or blogs. This enhances marketing of your future publications.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Building Websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These popular sites have cropped up in the last ten years. They help to connect people online whereby people can share ideas, photos, and events. People interact socially hence the name social media. The sites include&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;, linkedin.com, and myspace.com. Photo sharing sites like picasa.com also fall under this category of websites.&lt;/p&gt;', 'uncategorized', 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 'uploads/blogImgs/1540274046.jpeg', '3d_graffiti_background_ii-wallpaper-2560x1440.jpg', 'jpeg'),

Computers communicate by using Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, to contact each other, just like you use a phone number to dial a someone&amp;rsquo;s person&amp;rsquo;s phone. Domain names provide you with a simple human friendly way to locate websites on the internet! Your domain can be used for a &lt;strong&gt;website&lt;/strong&gt;, for an &lt;strong&gt;email account&lt;/strong&gt; or for both! When used for a website, this is what people will find your business with on the web. Example is like someone.com.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Web hosting on the other hand is like renting a space somewhere. Much of having a room in rental houses. The rental houses in this case is the server that offers various websites a space to place their website. the websites on the same server, if they are on a shared web hosting share the same resources like memory and processing power. There are other platforms like dedicated server, VPN server and others. The domain is the one that directs someone to the server that a website resides.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEB SOLUTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Your website is an important part of your business, make sure you treat as such! According to World Internet Users 2016 Statistics, there are over 3.6 Billion online users in the world, 9.3% of those are from Africa. Having an online presence in the web is the least so that customers, potential employees, business partners and perhaps even investors can quickly and easily find out more about your business and the products or services you have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital world, marketing solutions outline the growth of any business without limit to be known. Most businesses no matter the industry or size, need a professionally designed website that can help increase visibility, promote awareness and establish credibility for your business! Being a business owner requires a hands on approach with the launch of strengthened and powerful web campaigns, increasing sales and reducing marketing costs!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We have a group of certified professionals offering tailored solutions in the areas of Computing, Web design, Graphic design Internet marketing, Search engine optimization (SEO), Search engine marketing (SEM), and Social networks.

Attractive printing products always grab attention, which bodes well for a company, and this is particularly the case with business publications and business cards, whereas self-printed cards can often look cheap and unprofessional, and make people wonder about the quality of the products and services they will receive from the company&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Being a professional printing company we advise on every aspect of the flyers, including design, type face, illustrations, color of type, and type of paper best used, and even the color of the paper.

Most of the theoretical procedures learnt at school can finally be put into practice. At legibra company, I got an opportunity to explore different fields that I had no idea they could be achievable.

Mostly greetings and respect can take you far in terms of relationship with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Punctuality come in handy once you are an attach&amp;eacute;.

Since I was involved in the support team, sometime a client may be calling with range about a complain. One must be composed and make sure that once you are through with that client, he/she is satisfied with the results or have an idea of what was the reason for her/his issue. When clients are satisfied with the services that you are offering they will maintain at the organization and maybe bring others to the organization. Clients give an organization an income and hence its sustained.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 'uncategorized', 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 'uploads/blogImgs/1540274433.jpeg', 'city_skyline_silhouette_cartoon-wallpaper-2560x144', 'jpeg'),

Sometimes our system could be hacked and this posed a big threat to the data stored in our systems like websites and emails as they could be even deleted.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Blacklisting of the server. Once our server is affected with some even small malware. The server could be blacklisted by some institutions. This made some websites of the clients to be inaccessible and also some client couldn&amp;rsquo;t send or receive their mails.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Illiterate clients. Some clients could call the office for even the small problems like even setting up outlook in their PCs or complain that mails take long to send/receive even if their network and PCs were slow.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Desktops of low quality. Some of the desktops that we were using were very slow and thus slowed the rate of our performance.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Overwhelming tasks.

Multitasking and order of priority was the one thing I could use and even then I couldn&amp;rsquo;t complete the tasks in time.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Low server quality.

Also I had to check the mails for the support to check if there is any complain from clients.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;I made sure that each employees&amp;rsquo; PC was safe to use by installing antiviruses and updating them.
